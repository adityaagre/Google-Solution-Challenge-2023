# Google-Solution-Challenge-2023

I, along with Amay Chandravanshi have been developing an application for Google's Solution Challenge 2023. 
Among the 17 problems proposed by UN, we are targeting 1. Clean Water & Sanitation, 2. Climate Action, 3. Reduced inequalities.

Many city dwellers nowadays are aware of their responsibilities towards nature. However, it is often noticed that even though citizens would want to volunteer for such initiatives, they are seldom aware of them in time.
To bridge this gap, and facilitate citizens to play their part in fighting climate change, social issues, etc., we present to you, "Nat-Net".

"Nat-Net" A network to save the nature.
Nat-Net aims at providing a platform where users can learn about environmental and social projects such as cleanliness drives, tree plantation initiatives, awareness campaigns, water conservation projects, etc. in time and participate in them and confirm their spots by RSVP-ing. 
Users are also welcome to add their own events and attract volunteers.
We have used flutter-flow and firebase. 



You must first run the following commands to ensure the project compiles:

```
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This command creates the generated files that parse each Record from Firestore into a schema object.
